* Publishing

As of writing, this library isn't yet published, and there is no configured
task to do so (=sbt publish=). But, it should be pretty easy to set up if you
follow the instructions here: https://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Publishing.html

A good example seems to be this =build.sbt=: https://github.com/milessabin/spray-json-shapeless/blob/50581f40f3d226dd86c502887c72af84bba16654/build.sbt
