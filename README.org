* Publishing

Should be easy to set up: https://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Publishing.html

I like this example: https://github.com/milessabin/spray-json-shapeless/blob/50581f40f3d226dd86c502887c72af84bba16654/build.sbt

** Publishing Locally

Neat: =sbt publishLocal= publishes to =~/.ivy2/local=, which you can use in other
projects on the same computer as described here: https://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Publishing.html#Publishing+Locally
