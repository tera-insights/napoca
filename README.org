* Publishing

Should be easy to set up: https://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Publishing.html

I like this example:
https://github.com/milessabin/spray-json-shapeless/blob/50581f40f3d226dd86c502887c72af84bba16654/build.sbt

** Publishing Locally
Neat: =sbt publishLocal= publishes to =~/.ivy2/local=, which you can use in
other projects on the same computer as described here:
https://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Publishing.html#Publishing+Locally
* Testing

There is some progress on testing. I think that the most important thing is to
test based on the correctness properties of an outputted schedule:

- for a job to be scheuduled, all jobs with higher priorities must also have been scheduled
- the scheduler doesn't look outside of the given range of intervals
- a job is not scheduled if it violates resource constraints on a host

I partially verified the first one in =SanitySpec.scala=

The second one seems to be a subproblem of the third. 

The last one could be verified by walking the schedule and looking at the resource usage on each host
at each time.
